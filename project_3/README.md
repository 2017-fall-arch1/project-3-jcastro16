  Project 3: LCD Game

## Project Description
This project is called "Double Pong". It is meant to be played by a single player by pressing SW1/SW2 for lower paddle and SW3/SW4 for upper paddle.
## Objective
The objective of the game is to keep the ball in between both paddles to increase score by one everytime the ball interacts with either the upper paddle or the lower paddle. Once it hits the the upper or lower part of the game field, itsgame over. You can play multiple times to try to beat your previous score.

##Instructions
pressing following swictches will do the following:
pressing SW1= move lover paddle left
pressing SW2= move lower paddle right
pressing SW3= move upper paddle left
pressing SW4= move upper paddle right

##Unfinished product
While i managed to draw the playing field, show texts, shapes, and corresponding colors, ball paddle collison, and the the score, i was unable to implement sound due to time constarints.
